# Off For Shabbos

Jewish Law prohibits earning money during the Jewish Sabbath. Traditionally, this meant observant Jewish bussinessmen would close their store or business for the day... but how do we "close the store" in a modern "always available" online marketplace?

The "Off For Shabbos" project makes addresses the problem by dividing your online store in half. The majority of your website - product listings, shopping cart, FAQ, shipping policies, etc - don't charge the customer any money. There's no reason for OffForShabbos to disable those pieces! Instead, we disable only the checkout page. Your customers orders will be cached and processed after Shabbos ends.
